We have reached the halfway point in this course and 
you should be making some decisions 
about your project.

Due date:
To be announced

Project basic material published this week:
Lesson 6: Ethereum
Lesson 7: IoT
(more research project material will be published in lessons 8-13)

These two lessons cover 
how Ethereum works,
Ethereum smart contracts, 
tokens and their use, and
how DApps work.
IoT and smart contracts in economics/finance

These two lessons, together with the previous lessons
contain the ALL vocabulary you need to start reading (and understanding) blockchain white papers
and/or to start programming an Ethereum DApp.
After Lesson 7 homework is reduced to a minimum, to allow you to concentrate on your projects,
with the exception of one crytography homework.

There are three options we envision regarding the projects:

Option 1:
Programming project (personal or team) = 40% of the grade

Option 2:
Research project (personal) = 40% of the grade

Option 3:
Tutorial project (personal) = 40% of the grade
.

RESEARCH PROJECT==================================================================================================

RESEARCH PROJECT DELIVERABLE

Writing a research paper on a blockchain project involves
1. Reading and analyzing the white paper and 
economic strategy of a blockchain project of interest:
Analyzing the technical choices made (e.g. type of consensus, permissioned or public, etc.),
Analyzing the business strategy (e.g. what is the blockchain's purpose, what data is saved and SHARED between users), 
Analyzing the investment strategy (e.g. if there is a token or currency, is there a cap to the amount that will be mined,
how much will be distributed to the miners per year, what is the expected inflation of the token or currency etc.)
and
2. Analyzing the application website if it exists.

Ideally, you should write a case study similar to 
the one provided below:

SteemitHarvardCase.pdf and SteemitHarvardCase.doc

Your paper should have the following parts
(analogous to the above case, where we substitute
XXX for Steemit):

XXX: Introduction 
Platform built on Blockchain: (Discussion of the platform)
History of XXX
Why XXX?
Why Blockchain
How it worked
  Reward system
  Where did the money come from 
Strategy Considerations
Issues and Roadblocks
Glossary
Endnotes
Bibliography!

The length of the paper should be at least 15 pages,
and 600 words per page
(the 15 pages should not include the contents table, glossary and endnotes).
Turn in a .doc document not a .pdf (please)
A text similarity below 15% is acceptable as per Grammarly, so
A similarity of >15% will considered as high percentage of plagiarism.
Do not use ChatGPT as we have ways of finding out AI generated text similarity which
will also affect your grade.


Read the case (SteemitHarvardCase.pdf)
It is very interesting and as you read it, 
you will understand 
how to write the required sections of the deliverable.
However, you are not required to give a long detailed history
about any particular issue as the case does,
the only requirement is a description of the project's present status 
and a short history from materials available on the internet.
Obtaining financial information on a project is not always possible,
so search for a blockchain project that has some
published funding strategy (e.g. Polkadot does provide it)

RESEARCH MATERIALS (Lesson 7)

In previous versions of this course, 
we let students choose a blockchain of interest to them,
and we provided helpful reading materials and presentations written by us from which
students could start their research.

We have included some relevant materials in:

L7.Miscellaneous4\PrognosisOfBitcoin:
In Lesson 5 we covered Arthur Gervais simulation of Bitcoin and
one of the conclusions he reached was that Bitcoin will become unstable
once miner rewards have stopped (because the top number of Bitcoin=21 million has been reached) which
entails that miners have to survive on transaction fees alone.
What is the prognosis of Bitcoin under these circumstances?

L7.Miscellaneous4\Quoz.txt:
The BIS (Bank of International Settlements, the Central Bank of ALL Central Banks) 
recently published 
Blueprint for the future monetary system (basically, a stablecoin that acts like a CBDC, a central bank digital currency):
https://www.bis.org/publ/arpdf/ar2023e3.htm
This project is very important and everyone should be aware of it.
We have included a text file called Quoz.txt
that gives guidance in this topic.
Quoz is a finance thriller that is actually based on reality! We highly recommend it.

L7.Miscellaneous4\The_Unit.txt:
The BRICS  (a trade association including Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa)
recently published 
The Unit (a token backed by a basket of assets that pays no cash flows to the holders). 
https://unitfoundation.org/
This project is again very important as 
The Unit constitutes an effort to replace the U.S. Dollar for cross border trade transactions.
We have included a text file called The_Unit.txt
that gives guidance on this topic.

L7.Miscellaneous4\ChinaBitcoin and ChinaBitcoin.txt:
China's relationship to Bitcoin is ambiguous.
There are two books on China and Bitcoin, one for and one against.

L7.Miscellaneous4\Polkadot_RESEARCH:
Polkadot is the idea of Gavin Wood, none other than the creator of Ethereum's Solidity compiler.
The Polkadot/Substrate combo could very well become the next Ethereum.
If, as we suspect, a new blockchain wave is coming,
it is going to be based on Polkadot/Substrate.
This new blockchain wave has been accelerated by the economic harm caused by the Covid-19 pandemic 
which has basically set up major fiat currencies for hyper-inflation and 
has forced central banks associated with these fiat currencies to seriously consider
digitizing the fiat currency and get rid of cash all together.
So, since you are too young to have benefited from the first blockchain wave,
be sure you do not miss this coming wave and research Polkadot/Substrate.
Note that to understand the Polkadot/Substrate combo, 
you must understand Ethereum well first
so read the Ethereum materials carefully before you start.

L7.Miscellaneous4\Jack DorseytbDEX_RESEARCH:
tbDEX is another excellent project, by Jack Dorsey, the creator of
Twitter and The Block.  The idea tries to solve two twin problems at the crux of 
the new blockchain economy: the problem of identity and the problem of credit.

L7.Miscellaneous4\BitcoinPowerLaw_Readings.txt:
Santostasi's Power Law Theory of Bitcoin' s Price
has taken the internet by storm and 
has given rise to a strong debate arguing for and against.

L7.Miscellaneous4\IoT_RESEARCH
The surveys in the IoT_RESEARCH directory contain live links 
to all the white papers of the blockchains discussed in the presentations.
Approaches-to-Front-End-IoT-Application-Development-fo_2018_Procedia-Compute.pdf
is a good paper to begin reading, if IoT is your preferred topic.

L7.Miscellaneous4\StablecoinCurrentEventsMore:
The US government is promoting stablecoins? Why? 
Why should or shouldn't the US government promote them?

There are other topics of interest in L7.Miscellaneous4 that we do not cover here.

DApps provide additional research material (written by us or others)
on the economic and game-theoretic aspect of smart contracts that control crypto-currencies/tokens,
which might interest students with a background in finance or economics:

L7.Miscellaneous.2:
5. EthereumDAppsTokens.pptx
6. Stablecoins.pptx
7. RicardianSmartContractsAndGameTheory.pptx
8. Blockchain_GAME_THEORY_Survey.pdf


PROGRAMMING PROJECT===============================================================================================

We provide provide an Ethereum minicourse (Lesson 6)
with tutorials written, updated or corrected by us that 
will help you start programming an Ethereum DApp (actually,
you do not need to program everything from scratch as 
you will see below: you can simply adapt or enhance code).

In addition to the tutorials in the Ethereum Minicourse
you will do homework where you manipulate DApps such as:
Pet Shop Tutorial (Homework. due in two weeks, where you copy-paste and run code (no programming)). 
Ethereum faucet tutorial (Homework due in two weeks, where you copy-paste and run code (no programming))

The Ethereum Minicourse covers not only Solidity, but also
essential materials on Javascript that we have carefully chosen,
to minimize the amount of reading.
Javascript is needed to be able to render the front-end of the DApp, that is, the user interface.
Javascript is not a difficult language: 
the main difficulty is the asynchronous Javadscript part, 
which is the part that we focus on.


PYTHON MATERIALS:
If you want to program a DApp with a front-end in Python (as opposed to Javascript)
we also provide an example DApp:

IOT-tutorial_python_FIXED  

ADDITIONAL MATERIALS:
if you are programming from scratch or enhancing an existing DApp for this course and 
you want extra tutorial videos and extra reference materials on Solidity, Truffle and Javascript contact us via piazza.
We have personal resouces that we can share in that case.
We encourage you to take on the programming project because of the coming new blockchain wave,
It is important not to miss this job market entry, 
so take advantage of the opportunity the course offers!


PROGRAMMING PROJECT DELIVERABLE

You do not need to program a DApp from scratch, in fact, you can just adapt existing code.
You can start from a seed DApp (you must attribute your source to avoid the charge of plagiarism)
If you start from a seed DApp, you must add six (6) major modifications to make the DApp more useful
but these modifications can be obtained from code in other DApps we have provided (see below).

A major modification to a seed DApp involves 
the addition of a major feature and must include changes in 2 levels:

1. changes on the front-end such as changes to the Javascript (app.js) and HTML (index.html) rendering, and
2. changes to the Solidity smart contract (contract.sol) such as the addition of new functions (major features). 

In other words, you will probably have to write:
6 new functions in the .sol contract and
6 new functions in the app.js 
You do NOT need to write 6 new .sol contracts (integrate all new functions within a single .sol contract).
The executive summary should explain the new features and which files were modified to implement them.
See ExecutiveSummaryExample.pdf

The 6 new features need not be programmed from scratch: 
You can enrich one DApp (we suggest the Petshop DApp) by transferring features 
from another DApp (not from another Petshop DApp,* from a different DApp) that you have studied 
For example, you can add to the Petshop DApp 6 features minimum (more is possible) included from:

1. a way of adding/registering pets (and their photos**), for a fee, to be adopted transferred from Marketplace or somewhere else, adding a new data structure (dynamic array or mapping etc.).
If you access the file-system for the photos etc. this counts as a 2 features.
2. a way of voting for the best pets (or liking a pet) in the Petshop DApp transferred from Elections.
3. a way of donating ether to the petshop transferred from Web3Basics SendMeEther, where only the petshop owner can withdraw ether
4. a way of buying a pet (can be an auction) transferred from Marketplace or Web3Basics 
5. a way of filtering*** for a list of pets (available pets not adopted already) of a specific breed, age and location etc. 
6. a way of filtering*** for a list of pets (already adopted pets) of a specific breed, age and location etc. 
7. a way of keeping track of and publishing the most adopted (or most purchased) breed
8. a way of keeping track of which owner has which pet(s) (possibly none or many)
9. a way of keeping track of which pet belongs to which owner (possibly none or 1)
10. a way of keeping track of a user's adoption history
11. a way of a way of keeping track of a pet's adoption history 
12. a way of keeping track of how many custumers have been served and how many pets adopted
13. a way of returning the pet, for a fee
14. a way of giving a pet to a friend, for a fee
15. a way of keeping a vaccination registry for the pet
16. a way to generate and award and use as payment PetshopTokens (coupons) (see Metacoin)
17. a way of buying PetShop services and/or products (like pet vaccination, grooming, pet food, pet toys, etc.)
18. a way of using the Paillier library to authenticate a PetShop administrator (see Cryptography_2)
19. a way for an administrator to add products or services to be sold or pets to be sold or adopted
20. a way of using an event to inform a user that a change in status has been successful
21. a way of donating to a particular pet, so the pet becomes more "adoptable"
22. a way for potential or actual adopters and PetShop staff to interact via a PetShop chat room
23. a way to restrict the hours of operation of the PetShop DApp to business hours
24. a way to provide the Canadian Dollar/Ethereum exchange rate for any effected transaction with an Oracle**** (counts as 6 features).
25. update your DApp from using truffle contract to using @truffle/contract (counts as 2 features)
26. a way of keeping track of the shopping cart 
27. any other blockchain functionality you can think of, including administrative functions

*If you find a Petshop DApp in Github you cannot just copy and paste features from it, because
the point is to adapt (and test) the code from a different DApp so you can understand what the code is doing.
Use any copied features found in any Petshop DApp in Github as building blocks only. 
In other words, any features (say features A, B etc.) you copy directly from a Petshop DApp in Github
do not count among the 6 required new features for the project, though
you can use those copied features (features A, B etc.) 
to build another feature (feature C) on top that uses features A, B etc. as a foundation.
In that case, feature C does count as one of the 6 required new features.
For example, suppose you copy transfer a voting feature from a Petshop DApp in Github,
you can use the voting feature so that the pet with the most votes 
will cause (using an event) the petshop to place the pet in the top left cell of the display table or
cause the petshop to buy more of that breed of pet or 
cause the petshop to modify the price of that breed of pet etc.
Another example, suppose you copy a donation feature from a Petshop DApp in Github,
you can use the donation feature so that the donation
will cause (using an event) the petshop to offer a small gift (PetshopToken coupon) to the donor.
In any case, make sure you mention which features you borrowed from where and how you enhanced them.


**you can access the file system or use normal URLs or use IPFS URLS. 
If accessing the file system, 
you can use the json file provided which reads from the file system or
you can use FileReader() or
you can use the fs module. 
To do this, add const fs = require('fs') to truffle_config.js and use fs wherever needed.
To use IPFS: see 13.IPSF_Dapp_ShortDEMO in the EthereumMinicourse.

***It is possible to filter by just using the front end: 
try to filter while simultaneously cross referencing the back end (=contract.sol), not just searching the front end (=JSON file). 
The petshop App comes with a very simple data structure (just an array). 
You can replace that array with a struct or a mapping that allows you to cross reference the back end better.

****You can use an available Oracle service or set up an Oracle service yourself.
Either way you need to use Ganach+Truffle IDE.
Available Oracle service: 
https://archive.ph/SA09u
Set up an Oracle service yourself:
https://archive.ph/de6V1
https://github.com/jrkosinski/oracle-example/tree/part1-step1

Not all the features require the same amount of work or make use of the blockchain back-end to preserve info
and this complexity (using the blockchain back-end or not) will be taken into consideration during grading.
Some features are difficult enough that they count double or triple. 
For example  way of keeping track of adoption history from the owner (or pet) point of view counts as a double feature.
The reason is that doing this feature is best implemented with a data structure like a struct or a mapping.
Using an event counts as a double feature.
Using an oracle to obtain information from the internet counts as 6 features.
Also taken into consideration is how much work was contributed per person (e.g. if you worked alone vs if you shared work with other team members).

You can, of course, introduce your own 6 features if you want different ones.
In any case:
If you start your DApp from scratch it should have 6 features too.
If you program a DApp from scratch or from a seed DApp please use the same framework as the Petshop or Election DApps (i.e. Solidity, TruffleContract, JQuery, Web3, Truffle, Ganache). 

Another option for a programming project is:
In this link you will find many DApps programmed in Truffle framework:
https://github.com/dappuniversity
you can choose one DApp and add 6 features to it.

Frameworks:
Use Truffle and Ganache (or Ganache-cli) framework
We strongly prefer that you use truffle-contract for contract interaction.
We strongly prefer that you use the JQuery framework for the user interface.
You can use React instead of JQuery, though
we believe JQuery is  more appropriate for this course.
Do not use any front-end framework other than JQuery or React.
For the back-end, please use Solidity and Web3.

Configuration files and libraries:
If you want to write a DApp from scratch:
you can use any of the Minicourse's DApps as seed,
(we suggest Metacoin),
keeping the project configuration and libraries
and erase the contents of the contract as convenient.
Do not use Election DApp to start a new project from scratch:
Election's Web3 and truffle-contract are a little dated
and websocket events may not work properly.

Testing:
Ideally, the DApp should test the 6 new or transferred features.
That is: it should include test files for these 6 features that
run with truffle test.
Include the testing in the mp4.

Team size:
3 at most.
If you work alone, I will take that as extra work (in your favor).
You  must include all team members in the Executive Summary.

You can also write a tutorial DApp for your own reference in the future.
Writing the script is a lot of work and can substitute for writing a personal project,
because you should explain in detail
the lines of code that use promises or callbacks and web3, not just
explain the solidity code (in the smart contract and testing parts).
You can use any seed DApp to do this, like the Election DApp or the PetShop tutorial,
where many things have been explained by the author but certainly not all.
(We do not recommend you start from the Marketplace DApp because it is very long
and uses React.)

So in conclusion:

You can choose either A or B:
A. Enhance an existing DApp with 6 major features, or write a DApp from scratch with 6 features or
B. Write a tutorial for a DApp

In either case, the DApp should be written in a
current version of Truffle 
(or as current a version as possible that is compatible with your DApp seed)
using Ganache or ganache-cli (THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL) and
a current version of web3.

The deliverable (for either A or B):

1.The DApp (=full Truffle Project Directory DO NOT PUBLISH YOUR DAPP ON GITHUB)
2.Detailed setup instructions for setting up and running the DApp,
including version numbers of:

If using Javascript:
Node.js version,
lite-server version,
Solidity version,
web3 version,
Truffle version,
Ganache version or ganache-cli version,
Front End Framework (JQuery, React, none)

If using Python:
Python version,
flask version,
simplejson version,
web3 version (Python)
Solidity version,
Truffle version,
Ganache version or ganache-cli version,
Framework (JQuery, React, none)

3.A video (e.g. mp4) that shows your operation and testing of the DApp
the video can include the Metamask and Ganache setup
followed by testing run confirmation
followed by operation of the dApp

If doing A (enhanced DApp or original DApp):
4. A one-fifth page 1.5 spaced executive summary 
The executive summary should explain the new features and which files were modified to implement them.
See ExecutiveSummaryExample.pdf
If you started from a seed DApp:
Describe the 6 features you added (original or transferred)
If you wrote a DApp from scratch:
Describe its 6 features
Describe which front end framework you selected (JQuery or React)

If writing B (tutorial script):
5. A one-fifth page 1.5 spaced executive summary and 
6. A min. 25 page (600 word per page) tutorial script (you can run over)
where the programming code word count does not count towards the 600 word per page wordcount.

NOTE ABOUT NODE_MODULES

Your project will be heavy to upload to Quercus 
because of the size of node_modules.
To reduce the size of node_modules
install ModClean: https://github.com/ModClean/modclean
and run the following line from the terminal inside the project:
modclean -n default:safe
Always make sure the DApp continues to run after you do this.
